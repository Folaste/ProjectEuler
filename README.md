# ProjectEuler
My solutions to solve Project Euler problems.

All files ending in .txt are files to help solve the problem and are named the same way: files/<given_file>.txt

After each problem description, the duration of the programme is recorded (based on an average of a few trials).

From September 25, 2023, projects will be implemented in either C++ or Python.
